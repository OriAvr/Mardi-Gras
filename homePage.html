            <h1>About The Mardi Gras!</h1>
            <p>
                The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including
                the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated for about two
                weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday
                (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there
                is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have
                several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take
                place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week,
                many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities,
                including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls).
                <br /><br />
                The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as
                krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The
                earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the
                earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several
                modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and
                events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming
                celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus
                (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as
                the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club—a predominantly African American
                krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The
                most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons,
                decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys.
                Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.
                <br /><br />
                While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon
                Street, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts
                and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the
                upriver side of the French Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the
                Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the
                Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi
                Gras day. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the "Meeting of
                the Courts" between Rex and Comus.
