        <h2>History Of The Mardi Gras</h2>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe,
            passing
            through Rome
            and Venice in
            the 17th and
            18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras,"
            or
            fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.</p>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de
            Bienville arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi
            Gras" when his men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de
            la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile
            celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.</p>


        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to
            those that form our current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society"
            was formed and paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along
            on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming
            Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.</p>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was
            celebrated
            openly in New
            Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis
            de
            Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras
            balls of
            today.</p>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to
            the
            Spanish
            colonial governing
            body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs
            and
            carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.</p>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with
            carriages
            and horseback
            riders to
            celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and
            lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the
            Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought
            magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe
            members remained anonymous.</p>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed.
            This is
            also the
            first
            recorded
            account of Mardi Gras "throws."</p>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even
            printed
            "Carnival
            Edition"
            lithographs of parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were
            always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details
            could
            not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these
            chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the float and costume
            designs
            of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought to
            life
            by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40 years was responsible for creating
            all
            of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.</p>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival,
            Rex, to
            preside
            over the first
            daytime parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced
            Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for
            justice;
            gold for power; and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable
            anthem,
            "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.</p>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans
            instead
            of France,
            culminating
            with Comus' magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic paper-mache'
            animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials,
            including
            Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a
            legal
            holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.</p>

        <p class="aboutPageParagraph">
            Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private social
            clubs
            with restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded by
            their
            members, New Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>

        <h2>Latoya Cantrell - The Mayor Of New Orleans</h2>
        <br>

        <div class="row">
            <p class="aboutPageParagraph col-sm-12 col-xl-6 pull-left">
                As Mayor of the great City of New Orleans, I invite you to visit our city to experience the excitement
                of Mardi Gras!
                <br>
                The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called
                Twelfth Night or Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.
                <br>
                Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
                Carnival clubs, called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade
                goers. Visitors quickly learn to say, "Throw me something mister!"
                The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu Social Aid
                &
                Pleasure Club and the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes
                add
                to the fun-filled day of excitement for revelers of all ages.
                <br>
                New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting place to
                be
                at any time of the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their
                lifetime.
                Make your plans now to be a part of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les
                bon
                temps rouler!"
