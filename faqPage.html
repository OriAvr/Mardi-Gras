                        No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not
                        believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official"
                        Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their products
                        or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by the
                        government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its
                        merchandise. In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras
                        celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.

                        The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi
                        Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.

                        Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                        Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.

                        Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through
                        Ash Wednesday. Check out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few
                        years.

                        The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it
                        will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your
                        clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                        somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then
                        you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!

                        the weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the
                        streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers.
                        If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are also great days
                        to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu
                        Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and
                        seeing all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

                        By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of
                        us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going
                        to every parade, because we used to use "taking the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags
                        (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch. Throws often include toys,
                        stuffed animals, beads and more.

                        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                        anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon,
                        since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of
                        St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching
                        position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't
                        have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in the suburban areas like
                        Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday
                        before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

                        The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday (generally the Sunday
                        closest to St. Joseph’s Day in March).

                        The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around their inner
                        city neighborhoods. Some sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner
                        of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes
                        by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu parade.

                        The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the third Sunday of
                        March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at
                        Washington & LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their feathers
                        and suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."

                        Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold thier "Super Sunday" parade on the
                        Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years,
                        there has been yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open
                        weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific details are available on
                        these events at this time.

                        During Mardi Gras parades, seats aren’t a necessity. Most people at the parades will be standing
                        or even jumping for throws—and in between parades, people are walking around and popping into
                        local restaurants for a bite. However, we recommend Grandstands for people who may have trouble
                        standing or walking for longer than an hour at a time.

                        For Grandstand tickets, go to New Orleans Parade Tickets.

                        of Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe decides on its own theme each year, which is often kept secret
                        until the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their throws, and their "official" Mardi Gras
                        poster (if they have one) reflect this theme. For example, after 9/11, patriotic themes were
                        popular.

                        Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some
                        are named after the neighborhood where they parade.

                        Mardi Gras organizations have events outside of their actual parade where sponsors can
                        participate. These include Zulu’s Lundi Gras Festival, Endymion’s big bash before their parade,
                        Metairie’s “Family Gras”, and the ticketed extravaganzas held after some of our parades (such as

                        Even though every parade is unique, Orpheus, Bacchus, and Endymion feature the most intricate,
                        massive, and extravagant floats.

                        According to Wikipedia, “While there is no official definition for "super Krewe,” it is
                        generally accepted that a super krewe possesses over 1,000 active dues-paying members and
                        maintains at least 500 riders for its parade each carnival.” Here at MardiGrasNewOrleans.com, we
                        think there’s a little more to it than that.

                        Along with a large membership, super krewes have huge, double- and triple-decker floats, much
                        sought-after signature throws, and celebrity monarchs. They also are known for their big before
                        and after-parade celebrations with big-name talent (i.e., the Bacchus Bash, the Endymion
                        Extravaganza, and the Orpheuscapade).

                        The first super krewe was Bacchus, founded in 1968. While founded in 1967, Endymion emerged as a
                        super krewe in 1974. Orpheus, founded in 1993, also enjoys super krewe status. Three all-female
                        super krewes also take to the parade route, including the Krewe of Muses and the Krewe of Nyx.
                        With 1,600+ active riders, the Krewe of Iris, established in 1917, is not only the largest
                        female Mardi Gras krewe, but it is also the oldest.
